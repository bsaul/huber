# Moving along

The `sandwichShop` package began as an effort to provide extra fixins' to the [sandwich](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/sandwich/index.html) package. It become clear however that an even more powerful framework could be created for computing sandwich variance estimators (and more), and thus [geex](https://github.com/bsaul/geex) was born. Development on `sandwichShop` has ended, but feel free to use this code if useful to you.
